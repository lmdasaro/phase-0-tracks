# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control helps create different versions of a project so that different parts of the coding process can be saved and reverted back to. It also allows the monitoring of different features added to the project, who made what modifications, and most importantly allows different versions to be experimented on before being finalized and merged to the master version of the coding project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a version of the code that was a copy of the master. The usefulness of the branch lets different people work on different aspects of the project independently of one another and can be quality checked before being merged back to the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
* A commit is when you create a save point of the newest modifications to a coding project in git. When you commit, you are documenting the changes made to the repository so with every update, people are able to see exactly which changes were made. A good commit message will state the specific changes made to the project. Of course, it is also important to use the same language that is used by other coders. Ex: "Add github definition." is preferred over "Added github definition."
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when you change the same part of a file differently in the branches being merged together.
