You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

1. SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users WHERE reviews.businesses_id = businesses.id AND reviews.users_id = users.id;

1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|5|Great Food!|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|Amir's Towing|2|1|Awful service...|2|5|5|Holly|Berry
6|Sushi World|3|2|Fish was gross and old and moldy|6|3|3|Angela|Jolie
6|Sushi World|4|4|THE SALMON WAS YUMMY!|6|6|6|Merryl|Streepman

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

2. SELECT users.First_name, users.Last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON reviews.businesses_id = businesses.id AND reviews.users_id = users.id;
