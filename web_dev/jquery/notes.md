1. find resources on the web that i can follow along and code with.
2. look at several different resources to keep me stimulated.
3. don't get sucked into a rabbit hole, and also don't get distracted and leave the assignment alone.
4. take notes or make/find a simple cheatsheet

The strategies that worked best for me were 1, 2, and 4.
