  <h1>Hello World! Here is a pic of a baby Ocelot to brighten your day.</h1>
  <img src="ocelot.jpg" alt="The cutest little ocelot kitten imaginable" style="height:500px; width:750px;">
  <p>Here is a paragraph of random text. So relationship woes are the worst, no? They really are. You put yourself out there to meet someone whom you expect to form a loving and lasting relationship with, only to have things go awry usually after becoming attached. Now I suppose it is best to end a relationship if there are problems. But I can't help but yearn to find myself in a relationship where everything is hunkydory and there are only small problems to worry about. I think being happy is important, and you don't need to be in a relationship to be happy, and if you're in the wrong relationship, that takes away your happiness. Steals it. Poisons it. So you need to separate from whatever negative influence it is and let your psyche rejuvenate. Hahaha... I know I'm sounding pretty lame. I just want to hit a point where I can comfortably say that I'm happy with the want of nothing else. That is the end goal. Bad goal? I don't necessarily think so. Anybody reading this? I apologize. I just felt like briefly touching on the subject of relationships and happiness. It sure filled up my paragraph. Heh.</p>
  <p>Order in which perhaps you should be content with life:</p><ol>
    
    <li>self</li>
    <li>career</li>
    <li>finances</li>
    <li>friends</li>
    <li>romantic relationship</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Hello World! (for the second time!)</h2>
  <p>Now this paragraph has some <em>emphasis</em> and some <strong>strong</strong>, some <i>italicised</i>, and some <u>underlined</u> things to show off some nodes. Meowwow.
