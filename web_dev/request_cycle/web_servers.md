A VPS(virtual pirate server) is a virtual machine or program that runs as though it were a computer. They have their own running operating system, and users can buy a VPS and run any kind of software that runs on that operating system. The advantage of using a VPS is if you want to run different operating systems, but only have one physical computer. Also, you can use that VPS to host a webpage.

It's considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system because the root user has access to files on the system that a regular user wouldn't have. It's dangerous to have additional access to things you normally wouldn't touch, so it's safer to have the same permissions of a regular user.
