<ul>
	<li>Semantic tags give more meaning to the organization of the file. header, nav, section, article, aside, blockquote, elements that are clearly defined and easy to tell apart are the semantic tags I find most useful.</li>
	<li>The browser displays elements top to bottom.</li>
	<li>The concept I found most difficult in this challenge was getting past tag names. I took too much time trying to figure out their semantic meaning instead of accepting their role and continuing on with the work. I think to improve, I can try to understand the function more and then revisit the definition so as not to waste time.</li>
