  	<p>Tiny is an adorable 5 year old chihuahua. He was born in Texas, but has lived a happy life in California. He enjoys lazy days, hunting, and refreshing night walks.</p>
  	He may be small, but he is <strong>fierce</strong>!
  	He likes to hunt a variety of critters:
  	<ul>
  		<li>lizards</li>
  		<li>gophers</li>
  		<li>small birds</li>
  		<li>field mice</li>
  	</ul>
    <p>He may be a affectionately called a <em>burrito dog</em>, but he should never be confused with an actual <a href="https://www.americanburrito.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AmericanBurrito_115.jpg"><em>burrito</em></a>!</p>
    He eats about everything, but his favorite treats have a heirarchy.
    <ol>
    	<li>duck jerky</li>
    	<li>chicken jerky</li>
    	<li>human food</li>
    </ol>
